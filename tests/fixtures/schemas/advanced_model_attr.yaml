      checksum:
        required: true
        description: >-
          A computed value which depends on the contents of a block of data and which is transmitted or

          The receiving system recomputes the checksum based upon the received data and compares this
          value with the one sent with the data. If the two values are the same, the receiver has some confidence
          that the data was received correctly.
